# slot-machine-game

A very simple slot machine game using HTML5 and JavaScript only. It illustrates how to use the canvas element on mobile devices and desktops.

## Build

First, install [Grunt-CLI](http://gruntjs.com/) globally using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (I assume you have pre-installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Run a local development server (livereload enabled) with this command:

```bash
grunt
```

Package your game (i.e. minify css, html and js) with:

```bash
grunt build
```

Compress your game in a zip file, ready for [CocoonJS](https://www.ludei.com/cocoonjs/) usage, with:

```bash
grunt zip
```
